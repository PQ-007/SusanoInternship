# Boundary Box Finding Algorithm in CROPCLICK Command

The algorithm implemented in the **CROPCLICK** command is designed to find the rectangular boundary of a single grid cell within a specific AutoCAD block, based on a user's click. It operates by analyzing the geometric entities (lines, polylines) that form the grid within the block's definition.

---

## Algorithm Objective

- Given a user's click point in the AutoCAD drawing, and a specific **BlockReference** (an inserted block instance) that is likely a grid symbol:
  - Identify the exact grid cell that the user clicked inside.
  - Determine the four corner coordinates of that cell in the drawing's global coordinate system.

---

## Key Assumptions & Inputs

- **targetBlockRef**: The `BlockReference` object, identified as the relevant grid symbol block closest to the user's click.
- **clickedPointLocal**: The user's click point converted into the **local coordinate system** of the `targetBlockRef`. This is critical because the actual geometric entities that define the grid are stored in the block's definition using these local coordinates.
- **Grid Structure**: The algorithm assumes the grid within the block is formed by perfectly horizontal and vertical line segments (from Line or Polyline entities) when viewed in the block's local coordinate system.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Access the Block Definition (BlockTableRecord)

- Obtain the **BlockTableRecord (btr)** from the `BlockReference` instance.
- The `btr` contains all geometric entities (lines, arcs, polylines, etc.) defining the block's appearance, stored in local coordinates.

### 2. Identify Candidate Grid Lines (Horizontal & Vertical)

- Iterate through every entity (`entityId`) in the `BlockTableRecord`.
- For each entity:
  - If it is a **Line**:
    - Check if the Y-coordinates of `StartPoint` and `EndPoint` are very close (within a small `geomTol` or geometric tolerance). If yes, the line is considered **horizontal**.
    - Check if the X-coordinates are very close (within `geomTol`). If yes, the line is considered **vertical**.
    - Store these lines in `horizontalLines` or `verticalLines` lists as `LineSegment3d` objects.
  - If it is a **Polyline**:
    - Iterate through each segment of the polyline.
    - Perform the same horizontal/vertical checks for each segment.
    - Add segments to the appropriate lists.

_Result:_ Two lists containing all line segments in the block definition that appear to be perfectly horizontal or vertical in the block's local coordinate system. These are the potential grid lines.

### 3. Find Bounding Boundaries (in Local Coordinates)

- Initialize four variables to extreme values (`xMinBoundary = -∞`, `xMaxBoundary = +∞`, `yMinBoundary = -∞`, `yMaxBoundary = +∞`).
- For **Vertical Lines** (X-boundaries):
  - Iterate through `verticalLines`.
  - For each vertical line, get its X-coordinate (`lineX`).
  - Find:
    - **Left boundary (xMinBoundary):** The largest `lineX` less than or equal to `clickedPointLocal.X`.
    - **Right boundary (xMaxBoundary):** The smallest `lineX` greater than or equal to `clickedPointLocal.X`.
- For **Horizontal Lines** (Y-boundaries):
  - Similarly, find:
    - **Bottom boundary (yMinBoundary):** Largest `lineY` less than or equal to `clickedPointLocal.Y`.
    - **Top boundary (yMaxBoundary):** Smallest `lineY` greater than or equal to `clickedPointLocal.Y`.

### 4. Validate and Calculate Cell Corners (Global Coordinates)

- Check if all four boundaries have been updated from their initial infinity values.
  - If any boundary remains infinite, a complete bounding box was not found (e.g., click outside the grid or incomplete grid).
- If all boundaries are found:
  - Construct four corner points of the cell in **local coordinates**:
    - \((xMinBoundary, yMinBoundary)\)
    - \((xMaxBoundary, yMinBoundary)\)
    - \((xMaxBoundary, yMaxBoundary)\)
    - \((xMinBoundary, yMaxBoundary)\)
  - Transform these local points to the **global coordinate system** using `targetBlockRef.BlockTransform`.
  - Add these global points to `originalRectangleVertices` for further use (drawing boundary, cropping, etc.).

## How the Algorithm Addresses the Problem

- **Works in Local Coordinates:** Processes internal block geometry in the block's own coordinate system.
- **Targets Relevant Entities:** Focuses on line-like entities that form the grid.
- **Encloses the Click:** Precisely identifies the four lines surrounding the clicked point, ensuring correct cell detection.
- **Transforms for Global Use:** Converts local corner points to global coordinates, enabling interaction with the main drawing and other global entities.
